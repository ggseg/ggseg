#' ggseg: Plot brain segmentations with ggplot and plotly
#'
#' Plotting results from analyses done on data derived from brain
#' segmentations is a common need, but may be quite laborious.
#' Results from such analyses are usually easier to interpret if
#' the plot can mimmick the shape and position in the brain it
#' represents.
#' This package contains data from various brain parcellations,
#' with convenient functions to inspect the results directly on
#' a brain-plot wither with ggplot (2D polygons) or plotly (3d meshes).
