# ggseg 1.6

## 1.6.4
* Added options `hemi` and `side` to geom
* improved `position_brain()` to accept character vector, and also support subcortical atlases
* Altered axial to coronal in aseg atlas

## 1.6.3.01
* fixed broken geom after changes to ggplot2 internals  
* fixed spelling mistakes in docs

## ggseg 1.6.3
* removed function to display ggseg palettes
* preparations for CRAN submission
    * added examples to more functions
    * updated links

## ggseg 1.6.02
* bug fixes in atlas objects and method internals
* tests in vdiffr
* vctrs class for polygon ggseg data

## ggseg 1.6.02

* No longer depends on ggplot2, but imports it.
   * as is advised practice
   * users must explicitly load ggplot2 to access further ggplot2 functions

## ggseg 1.6.01

* fixed installation issues by making sure package depends on R>3.3 for polygon holes.

## ggseg 1.6.00

New large update, many new features.
Of particular note is the introduction of the brain sf geom, which improved speed,
and adaptability of the plots.

- `ggseg()` will stay for a while, but is superseded by a simple features geom  
- `geom_brain` introduced as a new function to plot the atlas data  
   - an sf geom provides a lot of new features to the package  
   - more control over display of the slices through `position_brain()`  
   - improved capabilities for atlases with regions that have holes  
- new atlas class `brain_atlas` which contains simple features data  
- new functions to allow compatibility between sf and polygon data   
- utility functions to use on the atlas data for easy access to information  
   - `plot()` functions for ggseg_atlas and brain_atlas classes for a quick look at atlases  
   - `brain_regions` functions to easily extract the unique names of regions for an atlas  
   - improved `print` method for atlases classes ggseg_atlas and brain_atlas  


# ggseg 1.5

## ggseg 1.5.5
- dk atlas regions renamed to better reflect correct naming  
    - pre central and post central are precentral and postcentral  
- dk atlas now also includes the corpus callosum, as the original atlas contains  


# ggseg 1.5

# ggseg 1.5.4

* dkt renamed to dk  
    - the dkt (Desikan-Killiany-Tourville) atlas is not yet available  
* atlas columns `area` renamed to `region`  
    - to avoid confusion with the calculation of cortical/surface area  
* dk atlas region name "medial orbito frontal" changed to "medial orbitofrontal"  

## ggseg 1.5.3
* Split ggseg, and ggseg3d into two different packages

## ggseg 1.5.2
* Adapted to work with dplyr 0.8.1

## ggseg 1.5.1

* Changed ggseg_atlas-class to have nested columns for easier viewing and wrangling

## ggseg 1.5

* Changed atlas.info to function `atlas_info()`
* Changed brain.pal to function `brain_pal()`
* Changed atlas.info to function `atlas_info()`
* Reduced code necessary for `brain_pals_info`
* Simplified `display_brain_pal()`
* Moved paletted of ggsegExtra atlases to ggsegExtra package

* Added a `NEWS.md` file to track changes to the package.
# * Changes all `data` options to `.data` to decrease possibility of column naming overlap
* Added compatibility with `grouped` data.frames
* Reduced internal atlases, to improve CRAN compatibility
* Added function to install extra atlases from github easily
* Changes vignettes to comply with new functionality
