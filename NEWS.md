# ggseg 2.2.1.9000 (development)

# ggseg 2.2.1

- The test suite now builds its `sf` fixtures through the public atlas
  accessors instead of reaching into atlas internals, so tests no longer
  break when the internal atlas layout changes.

# ggseg 2.2.0

This release makes the **`sf` package optional**. ggseg now draws brains from a
lightweight polygon representation by default, so it installs and plots even on
systems where `sf` (and its GDAL / GEOS / PROJ system libraries) is unavailable
— including WebAssembly and air-gapped setups.

## sf is now optional

- **Your plotting code keeps working, without sf.** `geom_brain()`,
  `position_brain()`, and `annotate_brain()` produce the same figures as
  before, now drawn without `sf`. `sf` has moved from Imports to Suggests.
- **Need the full sf toolkit?** To add region labels with `geom_sf_label()`,
  layer other sf geoms, or wrangle the geometry directly, convert an atlas
  with `as_sf_atlas()` and use `ggplot2::geom_sf()`. See `vignette("geom-sf")`.
- The sf-backed `geom_brain_sf()` and `position_brain_sf()` remain for a
  transition period but are deprecated and will be removed in a future
  release.

## New plotting features

- **Zoom in on regions of interest.** `position_brain(zoom = ...)` crops each
  view onto the regions you're highlighting so they fill the panel, with the
  surrounding brain reduced to a tidy grey frame. Use `zoom = TRUE` to follow
  the regions in your data, or name them explicitly; `zoom_pad` sets the
  margin. Especially handy for focus atlases where only a few structures
  carry values.
- **Readable view labels.** `annotate_brain()` now places labels clear of the
  brain instead of on top of it. The new `padding` argument (5% of the plot
  height by default) controls the gap.
- **One annotation function.** `annotate_brain()` works with whichever
  `position` you gave the geom — there's no separate labelling function to
  remember.
- **Hide context regions.** `geom_brain(context = FALSE)` drops the grey,
  unlabelled regions and tightens the layout around the regions you're
  plotting.
- **Faceting.** Group your data with `dplyr::group_by()` and `facet_wrap()` /
  `facet_grid()` draw the full atlas in every panel.
- **FreeSurfer labels.** Data keyed by `label` (e.g. `"lh_bankssts"`) now joins
  to the atlas directly, in addition to `region`.

## Other changes

- When no `fill` is mapped, `geom_brain()` fills regions with the atlas's own
  colours, and the stray "No shared levels" warning that appeared when
  filtering by hemisphere or view is gone.
- New `coord_brain()` keeps brain proportions undistorted; `geom_brain()`
  applies it automatically, so you rarely need to add it yourself.
- The deprecated `scale_brain()` family keeps working with the current
  `ggseg.formats`.
- The `suit` cerebellar atlas is re-exported alongside `dk()`, `aseg()`, and
  `tracula()`.

# ggseg 2.1.1

- Fix minor bug with ggproto

# ggseg 2.1.0

- Support cerebellar atlas type in 2D view stacking. Cerebellar atlases
  now use the same stacking layout as subcortical atlases in
  `position_brain()`.

# ggseg 2.0.0

This is a major release that simplifies the package architecture by moving
atlas data structures and utilities to the
[ggseg.formats](https://github.com/ggsegverse/ggseg.formats) package.

## Breaking changes

- `ggseg()` is now defunct and errors immediately. Use
  `ggplot() + geom_brain()` instead.

- Atlas data (`dk`, `aseg`) is no longer bundled in ggseg. Atlases are now
  provided by ggseg.formats and re-exported as functions: `dk()`, `aseg()`,
  `tracula()`. Code using the bare objects (e.g., `atlas = dk`) must be
  updated to `atlas = dk()`.

- The following functions have been removed and are now in ggseg.formats:
  `as_brain_atlas()`, `is_brain_atlas()`, `brain_atlas()`, `brain_regions()`,
  `brain_labels()`, `brain_pal()`, `brain_pals_info()`, `ggseg_atlas()`,
  `as_ggseg_atlas()`, `is_ggseg_atlas()`, `read_freesurfer_stats()`,
  `read_freesurfer_table()`, `read_atlas_files()`.

- `scale_brain2()`, `scale_fill_brain2()`, `scale_colour_brain2()`, and
  `scale_color_brain2()` are deprecated in favour of `scale_brain_manual()`,
  `scale_fill_brain_manual()`, `scale_colour_brain_manual()`, and
  `scale_color_brain_manual()`.

- `scale_brain()`, `scale_fill_brain()`, `scale_colour_brain()`, and
  `scale_color_brain()` are deprecated. Atlas palettes are now applied
  automatically by `geom_brain()`.

- The `side` argument in `geom_brain()` and `position_brain()` has been
  renamed to `view`.

## New features

- New `annotate_brain()` function adds view labels (e.g., "left lateral") to
  brain plots, respecting the layout from `position_brain()`.

- New `scale_brain_manual()` family for applying custom named colour palettes
  to brain plots.

- `position_brain()` gains `nrow`, `ncol`, and `views` arguments for
  grid-based layout control of subcortical and tract atlases.

- `adapt_scales()` now accepts atlas objects directly (not just pre-converted
  coordinate data frames), and handles `"tract"` atlas types alongside
  subcortical.

- `geom_brain()` now automatically applies the atlas colour palette when no
  `fill` aesthetic is mapped.

## Improvements

- Messaging uses cli for all user-facing output (`brain_join()` warnings and
  info messages).

- Rewrote and reorganised all vignettes with updated examples and renamed
  files for cleaner URLs.

- Added tracula (white matter tract) atlas as a re-export from ggseg.formats.

- Improved documentation throughout with updated roxygen2 docs.
