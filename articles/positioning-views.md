# Arranging brain views

``` r

library(ggseg)
library(ggplot2)
```

A brain atlas typically has several views – lateral and medial for
cortical atlases, or axial, coronal, and sagittal slices for subcortical
and tract atlases.
[`position_brain()`](https://ggsegverse.github.io/ggseg/reference/position_brain.md)
controls how those views are arranged in the final plot.

The function works differently depending on the atlas type, so this
vignette covers cortical and subcortical/tract atlases separately.

## Cortical atlases

Cortical atlases like `dk` have two layout dimensions: **hemi** (left or
right) and **view** (lateral, medial, etc.). The formula syntax mirrors
[`facet_grid()`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/facet_grid.html)
– left side is rows, right side is columns:

``` r

ggplot() +
  geom_brain(
    atlas = dk(),
    position = position_brain(hemi ~ view),
    show.legend = FALSE
  ) +
  theme_void()
```

columns.](positioning-views_files/figure-html/fig-hemi-by-view-1.png)

Flip the formula to transpose the layout:

``` r

ggplot() +
  geom_brain(
    atlas = dk(),
    position = position_brain(view ~ hemi),
    show.legend = FALSE
  ) +
  theme_void()
```

columns.](positioning-views_files/figure-html/fig-view-by-hemi-1.png)

### Stacking all views

Use `.` with `+` to collapse everything into a single row or column.
This is handy for compact figures:

``` r

ggplot() +
  geom_brain(
    atlas = dk(),
    position = position_brain(. ~ hemi + view),
    show.legend = FALSE
  ) +
  theme_void()
```

row.](positioning-views_files/figure-html/fig-single-row-1.png)

``` r

ggplot() +
  geom_brain(
    atlas = dk(),
    position = position_brain(hemi + view ~ .),
    show.legend = FALSE
  ) +
  theme_void()
```

![All brain views stacked in a single
column.](positioning-views_files/figure-html/fig-single-column-1.png)

## Subcortical and tract atlases

Subcortical atlases like `aseg` and tract atlases like `tracula` don’t
have the hemisphere/view pairing that cortical atlases do. Their views
are individual slices (e.g. `"axial_3"`, `"sagittal"`). That opens up a
different set of positioning tools.

### Horizontal and vertical

The simplest options. `"horizontal"` is the default:

``` r

ggplot() +
  geom_brain(
    atlas = aseg(),
    position = position_brain("horizontal"),
    show.legend = FALSE
  ) +
  theme_void()
```

![Subcortical atlas views arranged

Subcortical atlas views arranged horizontally.

``` r

ggplot() +
  geom_brain(
    atlas = aseg(),
    position = position_brain("vertical"),
    show.legend = FALSE
  ) +
  theme_void()
```

![Subcortical atlas views arranged
vertically.](positioning-views_files/figure-html/fig-aseg-vertical-1.png)

### Grid layouts

When you have many views, a grid keeps things readable. Specify `nrow`,
`ncol`, or both:

``` r

ggplot() +
  geom_brain(
    atlas = aseg(),
    position = position_brain(nrow = 2),
    show.legend = FALSE
  ) +
  theme_void()
```

``` r

ggplot() +
  geom_brain(
    atlas = aseg(),
    position = position_brain(ncol = 3),
    show.legend = FALSE
  ) +
  theme_void()
```

![Subcortical atlas views in a three-column
grid.](positioning-views_files/figure-html/fig-aseg-ncol-1.png)

### Picking specific views

The `views` parameter lets you select which views to include and in what
order. Check what’s available with
[`ggseg.formats::atlas_views()`](https://ggsegverse.github.io/ggseg.formats/reference/atlas_views.html):

``` r

ggseg.formats::atlas_views(aseg())
#> [1] "axial_3"   "axial_4"   "axial_5"   "sagittal"  "axial_6"   "coronal_1"
#> [7] "coronal_2"
```

``` r

ggplot() +
  geom_brain(
    atlas = aseg(),
    position = position_brain(
      views = c("sagittal", "axial_3", "coronal_3")
    ),
    show.legend = FALSE
  ) +
  theme_void()
```

![A subset of subcortical views selected by
name.](positioning-views_files/figure-html/fig-aseg-select-views-1.png)

A subset of subcortical views selected by name.

Combine `views` with `nrow` or `ncol` for a custom grid:

``` r

ggplot() +
  geom_brain(
    atlas = aseg(),
    position = position_brain(
      views = c("sagittal", "axial_3", "axial_5", "coronal_3"),
      nrow = 2
    ),
    show.legend = FALSE
  ) +
  theme_void()
```

views.](positioning-views_files/figure-html/fig-aseg-custom-grid-1.png)

### Grouping by slice type

The `type ~ .` formula groups views by their orientation – all axial
slices together, all coronal slices together, and so on. The type is
extracted from the view name (everything before the first underscore):

``` r

ggplot() +
  geom_brain(
    atlas = aseg(),
    position = position_brain(type ~ .),
    show.legend = FALSE
  ) +
  theme_void()
```

## Adding view labels

Use
[`annotate_brain()`](https://ggsegverse.github.io/ggseg/reference/annotate_brain.md)
to label each view with its name. For cortical atlases the label
combines hemisphere and view (e.g. “left lateral”); for subcortical and
tract atlases it uses the view name directly.

Store the
[`position_brain()`](https://ggsegverse.github.io/ggseg/reference/position_brain.md)
specification in an object so both layers share the same layout:

``` r

pos <- position_brain(hemi ~ view)
ggplot() +
  geom_brain(atlas = dk(), position = pos, show.legend = FALSE) +
  annotate_brain(atlas = dk(), position = pos) +
  theme_void()
```

![Cortical atlas with view
labels.](positioning-views_files/figure-html/fig-dk-view-labels-1.png)

Cortical atlas with view labels.

It works with any positioning — horizontal, vertical, grid, and formula
layouts:

``` r

pos <- position_brain(nrow = 2)
ggplot() +
  geom_brain(atlas = aseg(), position = pos, show.legend = FALSE) +
  annotate_brain(atlas = aseg(), position = pos) +
  theme_void()
```

![Subcortical atlas with view labels in a two-row
grid.](positioning-views_files/figure-html/fig-aseg-view-labels-1.png)

Subcortical atlas with view labels in a two-row grid.

Labels sit a little above each view by default (`padding = 0.05`).
Increase `padding` to push them further out, and tune the text through
standard
[`annotate()`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/annotate.html)
arguments:

``` r

ggplot() +
  geom_brain(atlas = dk(), show.legend = FALSE) +
  annotate_brain(
    atlas = dk(),
    padding = 0.08,
    size = 2.5,
    colour = "grey50",
    fontface = "italic"
  ) +
  theme_void()
```

styling.](positioning-views_files/figure-html/fig-styled-labels-1.png)

## Zooming in on regions of interest

For “focus” atlases – where only a few structures carry labels and the
rest of the brain is grey context – `position_brain(zoom = ...)` crops
each view onto the regions of interest, so they fill the panel while the
surrounding context becomes a tidy grey frame. Every view keeps the same
allotted cell.

### Focus on the regions in your data

`zoom = TRUE` focuses on whatever regions your data supplies values for
(or, with no data, the atlas’s labelled regions):

``` r

my_data <- data.frame(
  region = ggseg.formats::atlas_regions(aseg())[1:3],
  value = c(1, 2, 3)
)

ggplot() +
  geom_brain(
    atlas = aseg(),
    data = my_data,
    aes(fill = value),
    position = position_brain(zoom = TRUE)
  ) +
  scale_fill_viridis_c(na.value = "grey85") +
  theme_void()
```

![Each view zoomed onto the regions present in the supplied
data.](positioning-views_files/figure-html/fig-zoom-data-1.png)

Each view zoomed onto the regions present in the supplied data.

### Name the focus regions explicitly

Pass a character vector to choose exactly which regions each view zooms
onto, independent of any data you plot:

``` r

focus <- c("Thalamus Proper", "Putamen", "Hippocampus")

ggplot() +
  geom_brain(
    atlas = aseg(),
    position = position_brain(zoom = focus),
    show.legend = FALSE
  ) +
  theme_void()
```

![Zoom targeted at a named set of
regions.](positioning-views_files/figure-html/fig-zoom-explicit-1.png)

Zoom targeted at a named set of regions.

### Control the margin with `zoom_pad`

`zoom_pad` sets how much breathing room to leave around the focus
regions, as a fraction of their size (5% by default). A smaller value
crops tighter; a larger value keeps more context in frame:

``` r

ggplot() +
  geom_brain(
    atlas = aseg(),
    position = position_brain(zoom = focus, zoom_pad = 0.01),
    show.legend = FALSE
  ) +
  theme_void()
```

![A tighter crop using a small
zoom_pad.](positioning-views_files/figure-html/fig-zoom-tight-1.png)

``` r

ggplot() +
  geom_brain(
    atlas = aseg(),
    position = position_brain(zoom = focus, zoom_pad = 0.25),
    show.legend = FALSE
  ) +
  theme_void()
```

![More surrounding context using a larger
zoom_pad.](positioning-views_files/figure-html/fig-zoom-loose-1.png)

More surrounding context using a larger zoom_pad.

## Dropping the grey context

Set `context = FALSE` to remove the unlabelled context regions entirely.
The remaining atlas regions are re-gathered into a tighter layout:

``` r

ggplot() +
  geom_brain(atlas = aseg(), context = FALSE, show.legend = FALSE) +
  theme_void()
```

![Subcortical atlas with the grey context regions
removed.](positioning-views_files/figure-html/fig-no-context-1.png)

Subcortical atlas with the grey context regions removed.

## The sf workflow

If you work with brain atlases as sf objects – for example to layer
[`geom_sf()`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/ggsf.html) text
labels –
[`reposition_brain()`](https://ggsegverse.github.io/ggseg/reference/reposition_brain.md)
rearranges the sf data using the same arguments shown here. See
[`vignette("geom-sf")`](https://ggsegverse.github.io/ggseg/articles/geom-sf.md)
for that workflow.
