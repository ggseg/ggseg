# How geom_brain() works

The first time you plot three regions and get a whole brain back, it can
look like sleight of hand. You handed
[`geom_brain()`](https://ggsegverse.github.io/ggseg/reference/ggbrain.md)
a few rows; it drew the entire cortex, greyed the regions you left out,
and coloured the ones you named. There is no trick – just three small
ggplot2 pieces doing their jobs. Knowing what each one does explains why
faceting, aggregation, and colour scales behave the way they do, and how
to build on them.

``` r

library(ggseg)
library(ggplot2)
```

## The brain shape is drawn by a stat

The whole brain always renders, even when your data covers only a
handful of regions. That comes from `StatBrain`, a ggplot2 stat that
*generates* the atlas geometry instead of reading it from your data. It
is the same move
[`geom_sf()`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/ggsf.html) makes:
the shape is computed, not supplied.

A generated shape has a consequence worth stating plainly. A bare atlas
has no values to colour, so it draws grey.
[`geom_brain()`](https://ggsegverse.github.io/ggseg/reference/ggbrain.md)
is for putting *your* numbers on the brain; when you want to look at the
atlas itself, palette and all, reach for `plot(dk())`.

``` r

ggplot() +
  geom_brain(atlas = dk(), show.legend = FALSE)
```

![The DK atlas in uniform grey with region outlines and no
fill.](how-geom-brain-works_files/figure-html/bare-1.png)

A bare atlas: the full shape, drawn grey.

Give it data and the regions you have values for take colour. Everything
else stays grey, so the brain remains legible even when you have
measured only a corner of it.

``` r

results <- data.frame(
  region = c("precentral", "superior frontal", "insula"),
  score = c(2.1, -1.4, 0.8)
)

ggplot(results, aes(fill = score)) +
  geom_brain(atlas = dk(), show.legend = FALSE) +
  scale_fill_gradient2()
```

![Three regions on a red-blue diverging scale, the rest
grey.](how-geom-brain-works_files/figure-html/subset-1.png)

Three regions have values; the rest of the brain still renders.

## Repeated regions are combined

Real data rarely arrives one row per region. You might have one row per
subject, or per session, or per run. When several rows land on the same
region, `StatBrain` reduces them to a single value before drawing. The
default is the mean, and the `fun` argument takes any function that
turns a vector into one number.

``` r

thickness <- data.frame(
  region = rep(c("precentral", "insula", "fusiform"), each = 4),
  subject = rep(1:4, times = 3),
  thickness = c(2.5, 2.6, 2.4, 2.7, 3.1, 3.0, 3.2, 2.9, 2.8, 2.7, 2.9, 2.6)
)

# mean per region (the default)
ggplot(thickness, aes(fill = thickness)) +
  geom_brain(atlas = dk(), show.legend = FALSE)
```

![The three regions summarised by mean, then by
maximum.](how-geom-brain-works_files/figure-html/aggregate-1.png)

Repeated-measures data summarised by mean and by maximum.

``` r


# the maximum instead
ggplot(thickness, aes(fill = thickness)) +
  geom_brain(atlas = dk(), fun = max, show.legend = FALSE)
```

## Faceting comes for free

Here is where being a real stat pays off. ggplot2 recomputes a stat once
per facet panel, so the complete brain appears in every panel straight
from your data. No
[`group_by()`](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/group_by.html), no
copying the atlas by hand –
[`facet_wrap()`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/facet_wrap.html)
and
[`facet_grid()`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/facet_grid.html)
behave exactly as they do for any other geom.

``` r

cohorts <- expand.grid(
  region = c("precentral", "insula", "fusiform", "superior parietal"),
  group = c("patients", "controls")
)
cohorts$score <- rnorm(nrow(cohorts))

ggplot(cohorts, aes(fill = score)) +
  geom_brain(atlas = dk(), show.legend = FALSE) +
  facet_wrap(~group, ncol = 1) +
  scale_fill_gradient2()
```

![Two stacked brains, one per cohort, four regions
coloured.](how-geom-brain-works_files/figure-html/facet-1.png)

One brain per cohort, each drawn from that cohort’s own rows.

Each panel is summarised on its own rows, so the same region can read
differently from one panel to the next.

## Colour, including bins, is just a scale

`StatBrain` hands the geom an ordinary continuous `fill`. That one fact
means every ggplot2 fill scale works without ggseg doing anything
special.

So how would you make a binned map – discrete steps instead of a smooth
gradient? You do not reach for a ggseg feature; you reach for a scale. A
stepped scale bins the aggregated value for you.

``` r

ggplot(thickness, aes(fill = thickness)) +
  geom_brain(atlas = dk()) +
  scale_fill_steps(n.breaks = 4)
```

![The atlas in four discrete colour steps from a binned
scale.](how-geom-brain-works_files/figure-html/bins-scale-1.png)

Binning the aggregated value with a stepped scale.

When your bins carry meaning – a threshold, a clinical band – cut the
values yourself and map the resulting factor.

``` r

thickness$band <- cut(
  thickness$thickness,
  breaks = c(-Inf, 2.7, 3.0, Inf),
  labels = c("thin", "typical", "thick")
)

ggplot(thickness, aes(fill = band)) +
  geom_brain(atlas = dk())
```

![Regions coloured by a factor: thin, typical, and
thick.](how-geom-brain-works_files/figure-html/bins-cut-1.png)

Named bands, made with cut() and mapped as a discrete fill.

The division of labour is the point: the stat decides how many rows
become one value, and the scale decides how that value becomes a colour.
Continuous gradients, viridis, diverging, binned, stepped, and manual
palettes all compose the same way.

## The three pieces, if you want to build on them

Under
[`geom_brain()`](https://ggsegverse.github.io/ggseg/reference/ggbrain.md)
sit three ggproto objects, each with a narrow job.

`StatBrain` generates the atlas geometry per panel, reduces your values
per region with `fun`, and joins them onto the shape. It emits the
polygon `x` and `y`, the `group` and `subgroup` that encode ring
structure and holes, and passes your `fill` straight through.

`GeomBrain` is a thin `GeomPolygon` subclass. Its only additions are the
brain defaults – a grey fill and a `grey35` outline – and both step
aside the moment you map an aesthetic of your own.

`LayerBrain` is the layer that runs at plot-build time. It flattens the
atlas, hands the geometry to the stat, and quietly maps the join keys as
aesthetics so `region` and `label` survive into the stat.

[`stat_brain()`](https://ggsegverse.github.io/ggseg/reference/stat_brain.md)
is the stat-first spelling of
[`geom_brain()`](https://ggsegverse.github.io/ggseg/reference/ggbrain.md)
– both build the same layer. Reach for it when you want `StatBrain`
paired with a different geom, such as drawing the atlas vertices as a
point cloud.

``` r

ggplot() +
  stat_brain(atlas = dk(), geom = "point", size = 0.1)
```

![The atlas as a dense cloud of small grey
points.](how-geom-brain-works_files/figure-html/stat-brain-1.png)

Everything else you already use –
[`position_brain()`](https://ggsegverse.github.io/ggseg/reference/position_brain.md)
layouts,
[`coord_brain()`](https://ggsegverse.github.io/ggseg/reference/coord_brain.md),
the `scale_*_brain()` palettes,
[`theme_brain()`](https://ggsegverse.github.io/ggseg/reference/theme_brain.md)
– sits on top of these three pieces without changes.
